[Positivum](https://positivum.tomasfernandes.dev/) consits of a web application and a backend service which categorizes news articles by their sentiment.

## How it works
Every few minutes, a background service written in Python queries different RSS feeds stored in the database and classifies them using a model.
The web application written in flask then displays the articles in the database to the users.

## Model
The model is based on BERT. I used the transformers library to create a classification model using BBC articles annotated by myself.
Currently, the dataset is quite small and this is why the sentiment analysis is not as accurate as I would like.
In the future, this could be improved by completing some of the goals mentioned below.

For documentation purposes all iterations of my training scripts were saved.

The most up-to-date model can be found below:
- [Model (tf_model.h5)](https://storage.tomasfernandes.dev/positivum/model/tf_model.h5)
- [Config (config.json)](https://storage.tomasfernandes.dev/positivum/model/config.json)

## Dependencies
The required dependencies for each component of Positivum are listed in the `requirements.txt` file inside the corresponding directory.

## Goals
- [x] Create a reasonable model which is able to classify the title of news articles as positive/neutral and negative.
- [x] Create a backend service which is able to query and store articles from different RSS feeds which are fetched from the database.
- [x] Create a web application which displays the articles stored in the database.
- [ ] Improve the web application appearance.
- [ ] Show a shorter page navigation when the number of pages is big.
- [ ] Allow users to vote on the article's sentiment.
- [ ] Use feedback from users to train and improve the model.
- [ ] Share articles feature.
- [ ] Show confidence in each sentiment on the web application.
- [ ] Release document describing the progress of this project.

## Dataset Source
The current dataset was annotated by myself, but is based on the following publication:
